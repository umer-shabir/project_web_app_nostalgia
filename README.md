Introduction

This is a code repository for the Project Java and Web Development Application called Nostalgia. It is a straightforward social media platform that allows users to share important occasions of their life. It is a CRUD application where the user can create, read, update and delete the posts, additionally the user can also like the posts.

The application is build using MERN stack, The MERN stack consists of Node.js, MongoDB, Express and React. The posts are created in the React front-end web page, the data filled by the user goes to Express server, where it is processed and then directly stored in the MongoDB database.

Setup

To run this application first you need to have Node Js installed: https://nodejs.org/en/

A code editor is required to work with the project files, I recommend the editor Visual Studio Code, from https://code.visualstudio.com/

For database storage we use MongoDB, specifically their cloud Atlas version of mongoDB, the database is hosted on ther cloud. Therefore before running the application, setup a mongoDB cluster by registering at https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database

In the \server\\.env file, add the connection URL string to connect the application to your MongoDB database before starting.

On the client terminal use the following commands to start the client side
